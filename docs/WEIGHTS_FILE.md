## Weights File

A weights file assigns points to the tests in a recipe.

The weights file is linked to a RECIPE_FILE through the variable WEIGHTS (see [./RECIPE\_FILE.md](./RECIPE\_FILE.md))

The structure of a weights file is simply a series of "TEST_NAME: int"

Test names are generated by running ```guac list --recipe RECIPE_NAME```
